Sprout is a platform for developers to connect and grow together. Stay on top of what is fresh and trending in tech so that you can grow your business, or even just yourself.

Sprout allows developers to recommend and discuss new technologies as they emerge. Currently, users can submit libraries and APIs that they find useful and would recommend to other developers. As Sprout continues to grow, we will add functionality that allows users to submit additional criteria, such as quality of documentation and GitHub activity.

User submitted technologies are then added to the Sprout database and displayed in the appropriate table. We are currently implementing a voting system. Once complete, tables will update according to how users score the technologies.

Sprout also serves as a platforms for users to practice utilizing new technologies that they discover. The Projects page shows a list of activities users can work on in order to hone their skills and learn some new tricks. These projects are submitted by users and curated by Sprout admin in order to ensure they meet standards set to ensure a quality learning experience.

Sprout is a work in progress and is currently in its second phase of development. We are working on implementing quality user authentication that will allow for more intensive involvement with the site. Once this authentication is in place, we will begin creating user profiles, a comment/messaging system and incentives for continued learning and growing.
